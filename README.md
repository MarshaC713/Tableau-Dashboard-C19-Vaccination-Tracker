### Data Grouping and Visualisations
- **Filters** Start date, end date, continent and country
- **Stacked Bar Chart** Partially Vaccinated (Green) vs Fully Vaccinated(Blue) Per Location
- **Global Map** Geographical Vaccinations per hundred (The darker the region, the higher the number of vaccinations)
- **Scatter Plot** Vaccinations per GDP 

### Key Performance Predictors(KPI's)
- **KPI 1** Number of people within global population who are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19
- **KPI 2** Number of people within global population who are **fully** vaccinated against COVID 19
- **KPI 3** Percentage of people within global population who are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19

## Analysis üîç
### Key Figures
- **KPI 1** 3,838,352,700
- **KPI 2** 2,940,774,429
- **KPI 3** 51.26%

### <img src="https://github.com/SP-XD/SP-XD/blob/main/images/lightning.gif?raw=true" width="12" /> Key Facts: 
- We can therefore deduce that: 
- During the period between 4 Sept 2020 and 25 Oct 2021, **48.74%** of the global population had recieved at least one Covid 19 vaccination dose
 **897,578,271** more people were are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19 than those **fully** vaccinated during time period stated, which is a difference of **23%.**
- `There is a strong correlation between the GDP per capita of a region and the number of its population that are fully vaccinated.

## Analysis üîç
Key figures for this region during the time period stated now change from the global overview outlined above to the following:
### Key Figures
- **KPI 1** 158,464,224
- **KPI 2** 115,489,354
- **KPI 3** 25.95%

### <img src="https://github.com/SP-XD/SP-XD/blob/main/images/lightning.gif?raw=true" width="12" /> Key Facts: 
- We can therefore deduce that: 
- During the period between 4 Sept 2020 and 25 Oct 2021, **74.05%** of the ***South American*** population had recieved at least one Covid 19 vaccination dose
- The number of people who were only **partially** vaccinated stood at 158,464,224 compared to the number of people within global population who are **fully** vaccinated, which stood at 115,489,354.
- Therefore **42,974,870** more people were are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19 than those **fully** vaccinated during time period stated, which is a difference of **27%.**
