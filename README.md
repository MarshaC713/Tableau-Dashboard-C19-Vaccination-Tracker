**Tableau Dashboard Covid 19 Vaccination Tracker** which explores what share of the global population had been been either partially or fully vaccinated, during the set time period of **4 Sept 2020** to **25 Oct 2021**

### Dashboard Overview

### Data Grouping and Visualisations
- **Filters** Start date, end date, continent and country
- **Stacked Bar Chart** Partially Vaccinated (Green) vs Fully Vaccinated(Blue) Per Location
- **Global Map** Geographical Vaccinations per hundred (The darker the region, the higher the number of vaccinations)
- **Scatter Plot** Vaccinations per GDP 

### Key Performance Predictors(KPI's)
- **KPI 1** Number of people within global population who are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19
- **KPI 2** Number of people within global population who are **fully** vaccinated against COVID 19
- **KPI 3** Percentage of people within global population who are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19

## Analysis üîç
### Key Figures
- **KPI 1** 3,838,352,700
- **KPI 2** 2,940,774,429
- **KPI 3** 51.26%

### <img src="https://github.com/SP-XD/SP-XD/blob/main/images/lightning.gif?raw=true" width="12" /> Key Facts: 
- We can therefore deduce that: 
- During the period between 4 Sept 2020 and 25 Oct 2021, **48.74%** of the global population had recieved at least one Covid 19 vaccination dose
 **897,578,271** more people were are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19 than those **fully** vaccinated during time period stated, which is a difference of **23%.**
- There is a strong correlation between the GDP per capita of a region and the number of its population that are fully vaccinated.

## Analysis üîç
Key figures for this region during the time period stated now change from the global overview outlined above to the following:
### Key Figures
- **KPI 1** 158,464,224
- **KPI 2** 115,489,354
- **KPI 3** 25.95%

### <img src="https://github.com/SP-XD/SP-XD/blob/main/images/lightning.gif?raw=true" width="12" /> Key Facts: 
- We can therefore deduce that: 
- During the period between 4 Sept 2020 and 25 Oct 2021, **74.05%** of the ***South American*** population had recieved at least one Covid 19 vaccination dose
- The number of people who were only **partially** vaccinated stood at 158,464,224 compared to the number of people within global population who are **fully** vaccinated, which stood at 115,489,354.
- Therefore **42,974,870** more people were are only **partially** vaccinated against COVID 19 than those **fully** vaccinated during time period stated, which is a difference of **27%.**

 
### Stacked Bar Chart - Partially Vaccinated (Green) vs Fully Vaccinated(Blue) Per Country in South America

<img width="600" alt="marshac713" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82414822/210294504-ae288f35-647d-4ff1-8694-68dd9c917bd1.png">

- The visualisation above clearly depicts **Chile** as the South American country with the highest number of vaccinations, with **Uruguay** coming in second.
- In Chile, **84.87%** of the population had recieved at least one dose of the Covid 19 vaccination, **76.14%** of which were fully vaccinated, only **8.73%** were partially vaccinated (only received one dose). 
In Uruguay, **79.14%** of the population had been vaccinated, **75.05%** of those had been fully vaccinated, leaving only **4.09%** of those that had been vaccinated receiving one dose. 
- This is in stark contrast to **Venezuela**, where only **34.58%** of its total population had been vaccinated, of which **21.57%** had received all doses (fully vaccinated), while **13.01%** of those who had been vaccinated, only received one dose (partial vaccination). 
- We can also deduce that the disparity between full and ***partial*** vaccination in Venezuela is much higher than the top two vaccinated countries in that region, approximately triple that of Uruguay and just under double that of Chile.
- Colombia ranks in the middle of the dataset. It is clearly depicted as the country with 6 countries, above it that have a greater percentage of their population vaccinated, and the same number of countries, performing worse than it, with a lower percentage of population vaccinated.

- The map above confirms above analysis, with Chile and Uruguay, depicted in the darkest hue, denoting the regions with the highest number of vaccinations per hundred and countries such as Venezuela and simular performing regions, showing up in lighter hues of green and Colombia depicted in a hue in the middle of the range of these two extremes.


###  Scatter Plot Total Number of Vaccinations Vs GDP Per Capita
<img width="600" alt="marshac713" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82414822/210294132-d759e9d5-15a7-40aa-b4dd-80a2c16b4fc2.png">

- In the scatter plot above, countries in the region are represented by green circles, the data points and a red line of best fit runs through the data points to display the relationship between countries with high rates of vaccination and the GDP per Capita of that country.
- GDP per capita provides a basic measure of the value of output per person, which is an indirect indicator of per capita income. Growth in GDP and GDP per capita are considered broad measures of economic growth. Sustained economic growth increases average incomes and is strongly linked to poverty reduction. In other words, when an economy generates more value per person per year, that typically translates into more money for those working in that economy. Higher incomes mean families can spend more on the things they value and the country as a whole would have better infrastructure such as a greater quantity and quality of hospitals, GPs and vaccination centres, educational institutions and access to information, transportation systems and access to travel.
- This visualisation shows that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables, as GDP increases so does vaccination rates. Chile and Uruguay are at the top of the graph in the upper right portion of the graph (highest quartile) relatively close to the line, and countries such as Boliva close to the line and in the lowest quartile of the data(bottom left of graph). 
- Countries such as Venezuela are outliers, furthest away from the line of best fit, followed by Suriname for countries with low vaccine take up.
- Venezuela is not beneath Bolivia in terms of GDP as the trend suggests, likewise for Suriname, which should be between Gayana and Paraguay. 
- Brazil and Ecuador with relatively higher vaccine take up are also outliers and not positioned where would expect.   
- This suggests that additional factors are coming into play for for these countries, with the outliers being more susceptible and that the wider sociopolitical climate should be considered for context.
